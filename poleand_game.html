    Welcome to Poleand The goal is to eliminate all enemies (purple healthbars)!

    To do this, you have atomic troops, of either positive or negative polarity. Opposite polarities attract, and kill each other. Same polarities ignore each other. You can change polarities of your OWN troops at any time. Each wave increases in difficulty.

    There are 5 units to pick from, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Some shoot base neutrons which only deal damage, others shoot electrons which also change the polarity of the unit they hit to be the same polarity as them.

    If you run out of money and troops - goodbye, the atoms took over the page and now you have to refresh! See how long you can survive in the gruesome and brutal world of Poleand.
